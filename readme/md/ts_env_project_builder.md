# HOW TO develop in typescript with ProjectBuilder

[README.md HOME](./README.md)



  **Notice to code prettifier**
  
  You are free to adjust the existing plugins for the ESLint code prettirier lib.
  
  The Eslint is active, and the js code is here:
  
  `workspace/ts/build_tools/EslintPlugins/EslintPluginJaisocxJS/src/rules`
  
  **Eslint config path**: `workspace/ts/eslint.config.js`



## How to define local dependencies in a new module

  `@jaisocx/` is used here like the example for a npm registry name for .ts modules,
  Feel free to use Your own.

  1. in module's `package.json`, like this:

  ```json
    "optionalDependencies": {
      "@jaisocx/event-emitter": "^1.0.x",
      "@jaisocx/template": "^1.0.x"
    },
  ```

  the dependency line, e.g. "@jaisocx/event-emitter": "^1.0.x",
  You get from the local linked submodule catalog's package.json:
  
  workspace/ts/Jaisocx_SitesTools/modules/EventEmitter/package.json

  ```json
    {
      "name": "@jaisocx/event-emitter",
      "version": "1.0.1",
      ...
  ```


  2. in the `workspace/ts/BuildData.json`

  add new json entry for Your new .ts module

  3. in the "dependencies" array, set every local dependency*, these You will use with npm link feature, .i.e building from local sources here in this project

  If a packages doesn't have dependencies, the field still remains with zero length array value. I left it this way t keep the placeholder reminder, since this is very convinient, when a package is modofied some day later, to add a dependency very easy.

  ```json
    ...
    },
    "dependencies": [],
    ...
  ```

  
  This json example is not working as is, but the structure is right, and all fields names are the right ones.

  ```json
  {
    "npm-registry-name": "@jaisocx",
    "modules": [
      {
        "path": "modules/Tree",
        "name": "tree",
        "build": true,
        "build-simple-enable": true,
        "css-importer": {
          "build": true,
          "cssFilePath": "MediaAndStyles/clean-start-main-webpack.css",
          "cssTargetFilePath": "MediaAndStyles/clean-start-main-resolved.css"
        },
        "dependencies": [
          {
            "name": "@jaisocx/event-emitter",
            "path": "modules/EventEmitter"
          },
          {
            "name": "@jaisocx/template",
            "path": "modules/Template"
          }
        ],
        "build-files": [
          "Tree.js",
          "TreeConf.js",
          "TreeConstants.js",
          "webpackAliases.js", // To publish on npm the aliases in this package from webpack.aliases.json
          "webpack.aliases.mjs", // To publish on npm the aliases in this package from webpack.aliases.json
          "webpack.aliases.cjs" // To publish on npm the aliases in this package from webpack.aliases.json
        ]
      },
  ```

  4. in the root ctalog of this project, start build `.ts` files to `.js`

  ```bash
    ./buildPackages.sh
  ```



## Prettify by ESLint
  > how to prettify .ts soures

  in terminal change to `workspace/ts/`
  
  the eslint config `eslint.config.js` is in this catalog.
  
  then, run eslint

  ```sh
    npx eslint www/modules/<YourModule>/src/**/*.ts --fix
  ```



## ESLint Modules:
  > how to develop eslint modules:

  here is the path, where some custom eslint rules within one custom plugin were developed.
  
  **Plugin Jaisocx**: `workspace/ts/build_tools/EslintPlugins/EslintPluginJaisocxJS`
  
  **ESLint rules files**: `workspace/ts/build_tools/EslintPlugins/EslintPluginJaisocxJS/src/rules`



## Customisation
  > customising `.js` builds and other tasks, by customizing the **ProjectBuilder**

  In the terminal change to
  
  `workspace/ts/build_tools`
  
  this is the root catalog of ProjectBuilder tool.
  
  Here resides .ts code:
  
  `workspace/ts/build_tools/ProjectBuilder/src/ProjectBuilder.ts`
  
  to transpile ProjectBuilder typescript code, if modified it,
  
  ```bash
    ./buildProjectBuilder.sh
  ```

  Then, You can use Your new ProjectBuilder version to build Your packages in this project:

  ```bash
    ./buildPackages.sh
  ```



## New Building

  - **ProjectBuilder**: Your other local dependencies must be linked. Use ProjectBuilder like documented above.

  - **A library by Webpack**: building a `bundle.js` by **webpack**:

  ```sh
    cd workspace/ts/Jaisocx_SitesTools/webpack_builds/ExampleTree
    npm run webpack
  ```

  - **reload** this `.html` page, opened in Your browser to see effect: `workspace/ts/Jaisocx_SitesTools/ExampleWebpack_Tree.html`
